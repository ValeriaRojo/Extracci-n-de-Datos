My large family are all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months (typically available mid weekdays from the middle of June to Labor Day), we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor (schedule and availability permitting and limited to guests 16 years and older).

When I am not hosting guests from around the world in Boston, I go out and explore the world and stay in AirBnB properties regularly.  I treat my host homes as I would my own and am always happy to talk and get to know my hosts and their recommendations!

Thank you for being part of this community and reading my profile.

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that._x000D_

During college, I picked up a part time job as a houseman in my schoolâ€™s hotel, less so for the money. More so to look busy. It was initially meant to be a past time, but one particular night left a mark I never forgot.

The job required me to assist the housekeepers. I was the grease to a well-maintained machine. Take off the bed sheets, remove the used soaps and towels, and empty the trash. You do that to every room. Simple right?

It was the last night for an opposing schoolâ€™s football team and my manager needed someone to clean up after them and then prepare the rooms for the next working day.

I showed up and cleared every room assigned to me. I thought nothing of it and went back to my dorm. The next day, I went back to work on my regular shift. 

To my surprise, everyone came up to me to thank me for making their day a hundred times easier. I was happy for a moment. But then I scratched my head thinking to myself, â€œyou all know that Iâ€™m getting paid for this right?â€

But then it dawned on me. I was looking at this experience through broken glasses.

Hospitality is as much a human experience for the guests as it is for the people who make that experience worthwhile. 

That day has inspired to me to strive to make every experience worthwhile. My goal is to facilitate wonderful experiences for people around the world.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.
